# Articles - List of arbitrary articles

This module displays a list of manually specified articles

Joomla 3.7 or later
PHP 5.6 or later

---

The article's selection field is taken from com_content, where it is intended only for use in a menu item and is not intended to be used in a subform type field.

The logic of use is as follows:
1. added a line to the subform
2. selected material
3. saved module parameters 
4. returned to step 1 if necessary

I made this module exclusively for myself and posted it here at the request of a friend. This work completely suits me in its current form and I'm not going to redo it.

If someone wants to redo the selection field of the article, I will gladly accept his edits.
