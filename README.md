_description in Russian [here](README.ru.md)_

This module displays a list of manually specified articles.

---

The article's selection field is taken from com_content, where it is intended only for use in a menu item and is not intended to be used in a subform type field.

The logic of use is as follows:

1. added a line to the subform,
2. selected material,
3. saved module parameters,
4. returned to step 1 if necessary.

I made this module exclusively for myself and posted it here at the request of a friend. This work completely suits me in its current form and I'm not going to redo it.

If someone wants to modify the article selection field for correct integration with the subform field, I will gladly accept its revisions.
